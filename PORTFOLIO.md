- LLM for normalization and structuring
- Fallback strategies for edge cases

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Multi-stage extraction pipeline
1. Fetch page with Playwright (handles JS)
2. Extract main content with Readability
3. Parse with BeautifulSoup for structure
4. Normalize with LLM (extract skills, requirements)
5. Store structured JSON in PostgreSQL JSONB
```

### 2. AI-Powered Resume Tailoring

## üé§ Interview Talking Points

### For Backend Roles

**"Tell me about a complex system you designed"**
> "I designed LaudatorAI's distributed task processing system using Celery and Redis. The challenge was handling multiple concurrent jobs with different priorities - job scraping is critical and needs immediate processing, while cleanup tasks can run during off-hours. I implemented a multi-queue architecture with task routing and implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for resilience. This reduced API response times from seconds to milliseconds while handling background processing reliably."

**"How do you ensure code quality?"**
> "In LaudatorAI, I implemented multiple layers of quality assurance: comprehensive type hints with mypy validation, automated testing with pytest reaching 80%+ coverage, CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions running tests on every PR, and code formatting with Black and isort. I also wrote extensive documentation including architecture diagrams, API examples, and contributing guidelines to ensure maintainability."

**"Describe a challenging bug you fixed"**
> "After deploying to Railway, the frontend couldn't connect to the backend due to CORS errors. I systematically debugged by checking environment variables, testing locally, and analyzing Railway's networking. I discovered Railway assigns a dynamic PORT that must be explicitly used. I fixed it by configuring the PORT environment variable and documented the entire process in a troubleshooting guide to help others facing similar issues."

### For Full-Stack Roles

**"Walk me through your most complex project"**
> "LaudatorAI is a full-stack application I built from scratch. On the backend, I used FastAPI with PostgreSQL, implementing a complete REST API with 15+ endpoints. For long-running tasks like web scraping and LLM processing, I built a Celery-based distributed task queue. The frontend is Next.js 14 with TypeScript, featuring real-time status updates and a diff preview UI. I deployed the backend on Railway and frontend on Vercel, with Docker Compose for local development. The entire system processes job applications end-to-end in under 2 minutes."

**"How do you make architectural decisions?"**
> "For LaudatorAI, I evaluated several options for each component. For example, I chose FastAPI over Django because the project needed a lightweight API, not a full framework, and FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation saves development time. I chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because the data is relational (jobs, resumes, applications), and PostgreSQL's JSONB support gives me flexibility where I need it. Each decision was documented in the ARCHITECTURE.md file with justifications."

### For AI/ML Roles

**"Tell me about your experience with LLMs"**
> "In LaudatorAI, I integrated OpenAI's API for two critical features: normalizing job descriptions and tailoring resumes. The challenge was prompt engineering to ensure consistent output format. I designed a structured prompt with clear instructions, examples, and JSON schema requirements. I implemented validation with Pydantic to catch malformed responses and retry logic for reliability. I also built an abstraction layer supporting multiple providers (OpenAI, Ollama, HuggingFace) so the system isn't locked into one vendor."

### For Senior/Lead Roles

**"How do you approach system design?"**
> "For LaudatorAI, I started by defining clear boundaries between components: presentation (Next.js), API (FastAPI), business logic (services), and data (PostgreSQL). I chose technologies based on specific requirements - Celery for distributed processing, Redis for fast caching, MinIO for scalable file storage. I documented all decisions in an ARCHITECTURE.md file explaining the 'why' behind each choice. The result is a system that's easy to understand, test, and scale."

**"Describe your development process"**
> "I followed an iterative approach, completing the project in 8 phases from foundation to deployment. Each phase had clear objectives and deliverables. I maintained comprehensive documentation throughout, wrote tests alongside features, and set up CI/CD early. I also created contributing guidelines and security documentation, thinking about the project as if it would be maintained by a team. This approach resulted in production-ready code with 5,000+ lines of documentation."
