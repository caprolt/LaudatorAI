- "How would you scale this system?"

**Code Quality:**
- "How do you ensure code quality?"
- "What's your testing strategy?"
- "How do you handle errors?"
- "Show me your most elegant code"

**AI/ML:**
- "How did you integrate the LLM?"
- "What challenges did you face with AI reliability?"
- "How do you handle rate limits?"
- "How would you optimize LLM costs?"

**DevOps:**
- "Describe your deployment process"
- "How do you handle secrets?"
- "What monitoring do you have?"
- "How would you debug a production issue?"

### Have These Ready
