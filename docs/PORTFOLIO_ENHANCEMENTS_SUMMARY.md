## ðŸŽ“ What You Can Say

### About Documentation
> "I documented the project extensively because I believe good documentation is as important as good code. I created architecture diagrams, API examples, and even a contributing guide as if this would be maintained by a team."

### About Architecture
> "I designed the system with scalability in mind. The distributed task queue handles multiple concurrent jobs, the API is stateless for horizontal scaling, and I used PostgreSQL with proper indexing for performance."

### About Code Quality
> "I implemented multiple layers of quality assurance: type hints throughout, automated testing with high coverage, CI/CD pipeline, and code formatting tools. The goal was production-ready code, not just a demo."

### About Technology Choices
> "I chose each technology deliberately. FastAPI for its performance and auto-documentation, Next.js for its excellent developer experience, and Celery for proven distributed processing. Each choice is documented in the architecture guide."

### About Learning
> "This project pushed me to learn several new technologies deeply - FastAPI, Celery, LLM integration, and Railway deployment. I encountered and solved real production issues like CORS configuration and LLM response reliability."
