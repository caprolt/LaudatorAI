<!--
This file is a scaffolded project plan that RepoTrackr can parse automatically.

What is RepoTrackr?
- A lightweight dashboard that reads a Markdown plan from your repo, extracts checkbox tasks,
  and shows progress (percent complete, counts, status) with minimal setup.

How to use this file:
1) Fill in the placeholders below (project name, dates, etc.).
2) Add tasks using these markers (RepoTrackr recognizes them):
   - [ ] Task not started (todo)
   - [~] Task in progress (doing)
   - [x] Task completed (done)
   - [!] Task blocked (blocked)
3) Commit and push. Then add this repository to RepoTrackr with the plan path (default: docs/plan.md).
4) Update tasks as you workâ€”RepoTrackr will reflect changes automatically.

Notes:
- You can place this file at docs/plan.md (recommended), plan.md, or keep a Plan section in README.md.
- Advanced: You may include a repotrackr.yml at repo root to declare the plan path(s) and customize markers.

# LaudatorAI â€” AI-Powered Job Application Assistant

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**Project Name:** LaudatorAI  
**Repository:** https://github.com/caprolt/LaudatorAI  
**Start Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Target Completion:** 2025-03-19  
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

**Description:** LaudatorAI is your AI advocate in the job market, inspired by the ancient *laudator* â€” one who praises and elevates others' achievements. This platform automates the tailoring of resumes and the crafting of cover letters to match specific job postings, ensuring your applications stand out with precision and polish.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [x] Define clear project objectives
- [x] Identify target users/audience
- [ ] Establish success metrics
- [x] Set project scope and boundaries

### Core Goals
- [ ] Ingest a job posting URL, extract a normalized Job Description (JD)
- [ ] Parse a base resume into structured JSON
- [ ] Generate a tailored resume (DOCX + PDF) and a cover letter (DOCX + PDF)
- [ ] Provide a diff/preview UI for human-in-the-loop edits

### Non-Goals (MVP)
- [x] Account creation & billing (excluded)
- [x] Multi-language JD parsing beyond English (excluded)
- [x] Advanced ATS scoring and company intel (excluded)

## ðŸ§© Architecture & Design

### System Architecture
- [x] Design high-level system architecture
- [x] Choose technology stack
- [ ] Plan database schema
- [ ] Define API structure
- [ ] Plan deployment strategy

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- **API**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Workers**: Celery (Redis broker)
- **Data**: Postgres (metadata), local MinIO/S3 (files)
- **Vector (optional, M3+)**: Qdrant/FAISS
- **Scraping**: Playwright + Readability fallback
- **LLM Provider**: pluggable (OpenAI/Ollama/HF via one interface)
- **PDF/DOCX**: `python-docx` + `weasyprint` (or `docx-template` + `wkhtmltopdf`)
- **Observability**: Sentry + basic logging; Prometheus later
